<!-- 
Shouting Machine

Create a page that asks the user to type something into a field, and when they submit the form, have the page say it back to them in all uppercase. Use console.log once â€” either to try it out or to debug an issue.

For an extra challenge include this functionality as well: an increasing font size with every form submission. This is tricky! Think about where you could save a variable for font size in your code that won't get erased after each form submission. Also, you'll need to consider that you'll be working with strings and numbers:

    a number for the font size so that you can increase the number on each form submission.
    a string for the actual value that you set for the inline style for text size. -->
